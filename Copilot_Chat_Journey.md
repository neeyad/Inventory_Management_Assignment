# Copilot Chat Journey: E-Commerce Inventory Management Service

## Overview
This document summarizes the collaborative journey with GitHub Copilot to design, implement, test, and document a production-grade C++ e-commerce inventory management service.

## Key Phases

### 1. Requirements & Architecture
- Defined service features: REST API, local JSON storage, audit logging, backup/restore, full test coverage.
- Outlined modular architecture: handlers, controllers, services, logger.

### 2. Project Setup
- Generated `CMakeLists.txt` for build and test configuration.
- Integrated dependencies: CppRestSDK, Google Test, nlohmann-json, vcpkg.
- Created source (`src/`), header (`include/`), and test (`tests/`) files.

### 3. Implementation
- Developed core modules: CategoryHandler, ProductHandler, SKUHandler, ProductController, ProductService, AuditLogger.
- Ensured robust file/directory creation and Windows-safe log filenames.
- Implemented backup/restore and audit log rotation.

### 4. Testing & Debugging
- Wrote Google Test cases for all modules.
- Iteratively fixed test failures: setup/teardown, file-in-use, reload after restore.
- Achieved 100% passing tests.

### 5. Code Coverage
- Integrated OpenCppCoverage for Windows.
- Generated HTML coverage report in `coverage_html/`.

### 6. Documentation & Export
- Created `Project-structure.md` for project overview.
- Exported chat summary and key commands in `Copilot_Chat_Export.md`.

## Notable Challenges & Solutions
- Windows filename restrictions for logs: used safe timestamp formatting.
- File-in-use errors: added logger close/reopen logic in tests.
- CMake/MSBuild troubleshooting: resolved header/class context issues.
- PATH setup for OpenCppCoverage.

## Final Outcome
- Fully functional, modular C++ service with robust testing and coverage.
- Clear documentation and reproducible build/test workflow.
