## Detailed Summary of Copilot Chat History

This document provides a comprehensive summary of the Copilot chat history (`chat.json`) for the E-Commerce Inventory Management Service project, including the latest clarifications and requirements.

### Initial PRD Review & Requirements Gathering
- The chat began with a review of the Product Requirements Document (PRD).
- Copilot asked targeted questions about:
  - Category management (uniqueness, nesting, deletion, parentCategoryId)
  - Product management (attributes, brand management, description length/format)
  - SKU management (attributes, allowed values, image fallback)
  - API details (response format, RESTful conventions, versioning, standard response structure)
  - Validation and edge cases (referential integrity, recursive deletion, audit logging, bulk operations)
  - Testing (coverage targets, report format, preferred framework)

### User Responses & Decisions (Latest Additions)
- **Category Management:**
  - Only one level of nesting (parent/child) is supported; categories have a `parentCategoryId` field.
  - Deleting a category with sub-categories or products requires user confirmation; deletion can be recursive.
- **Product Management:**
  - Brands are managed via API (create, update, delete, list).
  - Product descriptions support a maximum length and rich text/HTML.
- **SKU Management:**
  - Color and size use a list of allowed values, but no API is needed to manage these lists.
  - If a product has no image, a default image URL is used as fallback.
- **API Details:**
  - All APIs follow RESTful conventions and use JSON format.
  - API versioning is included (e.g., `/api/v1/`).
  - All endpoints return a standard response structure (e.g., `{ success, data, error }`).
- **Validation & Edge Cases:**
  - Deletion of entities is logged for audit purposes.
  - Bulk operations (e.g., bulk delete) are supported for categories, products, and SKUs, with limits per request.
- **Testing:**
  - Coverage report is included in the repository.
  - Preferred testing framework is `gtest` (for C++).
  - Coverage report can be in HTML or recommended JSON format.

### Copilot Follow-up & Final Suggestions
- Copilot recommended:
  - Specifying maximum length and format for product descriptions.
  - Clarifying deletion confirmation (API flag or UI prompt).
  - Detailing audit log contents (user, timestamp, entity, operation).
  - Listing supported bulk operations and request limits.
  - Providing a default image URL example or configuration location.
  - Confirming `gtest` as the required unit test framework.

### Project Outcomes
- The requirements are now highly specific, actionable, and ready for development.
- The PRD covers all major entities, relationships, API conventions, validation, edge cases, and testing requirements.
- All clarifications and decisions are documented for onboarding, auditing, and future enhancements.
